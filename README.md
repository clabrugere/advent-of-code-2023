# Advent of Code 2023

Contains my python solutions for the 2023 edition of Advent of Code. They are all combined into a jupyter notebook.

## Usage

Put problems inputs in the `inputs` directory. They should be text files named by the day number (e.g day 4 input should be in `04.txt`).

Execute the corresponding cell in `solution.ipynb` to get the answer.
